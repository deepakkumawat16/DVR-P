## R Hadoop – A Perfect Match for Big Data

### Introduction
R is a powerful tool for statistical analysis and data visualization but struggles with scalability due to its in-memory processing limitations. Conversely, Hadoop excels in distributed processing and handling massive datasets. By integrating R with Hadoop, data scientists can leverage Hadoop's scalability and R's analytical prowess to efficiently process large datasets.

### Why Use R on Hadoop?
- *Scalability*: Hadoop’s distributed storage and processing capabilities allow R to work with datasets beyond memory constraints.
- *Cost Efficiency*: Using commodity hardware clusters reduces costs while enabling parallel data analysis.
- *Data Analytics Synergy*: Combining R’s statistical models with Hadoop’s data storage framework creates a robust platform for big data analytics.

### Applications of R in Big Data
- *Exploratory Data Analysis*: Identifying patterns and trends in data.
- *Data Visualization*: R libraries like ggplot2 simplify creating advanced visualizations.
- *Industry Use Cases*:
  - *Finance*: Fraud detection, customer churn analysis.
  - *Bioinformatics*: Genetic sequence analysis, drug discovery.
  - *Social Media*: Sentiment analysis, targeted advertising.

### Methods to Integrate R with Hadoop
Here are various ways to combine R and Hadoop:

1. *RHadoop*:
   - A collection of packages (rhdfs, rmr2, rhbase, ravro, and plyrmr) developed by Revolution Analytics.
   - Allows data management within Hadoop from R.
   - Useful for reading/writing data from HDFS, HBase, and performing MapReduce operations using R functions.

2. *RHIPE (R and Hadoop Integrated Programming Environment)*:
   - Enables running Hadoop MapReduce jobs using R scripts.
   - Provides an interface where R functions act as map and reduce tasks on Hadoop clusters.
   - Best suited for distributed data processing while leveraging R’s analytics capabilities.

3. *Hadoop Streaming with R*:
   - Uses the Hadoop Streaming API to run R scripts as mappers and reducers.
   - Enables executing MapReduce jobs with any executable script, making it easy to use R without additional integration layers.

   *Example Command*:
   shell
   $HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop jar $HADOOP_HOME/hadoop-streaming.jar \
   -input InputDirLocation -output OutputDirLocation \
   -mapper /path/to/mapper.R -reducer /path/to/reducer.R
   

4. *RHive*:
   - Integrates R with Apache Hive, allowing users to run HiveQL queries from R.
   - Useful for parallel processing and avoiding unnecessary data movement between systems.
   - Ideal for applying R’s statistical models to data stored in Hadoop clusters.

5. *ORCH (Oracle Connector for Hadoop)*:
   - Simplifies the process of running MapReduce jobs using R.
   - Mappers and reducers are written in R and executed directly in Hadoop.
   - Provides high-level integration without requiring Java coding.

### Conclusion
Integrating R with Hadoop offers a powerful combination for big data analytics by overcoming R’s limitations with Hadoop’s distributed processing. This synergy allows data professionals to perform scalable, high-performance analytics using familiar R scripts, thus bridging the gap between statistical analysis and big data management.
